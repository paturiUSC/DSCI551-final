=======
-	Is it ok if pandas changes dtype from int to float when reading in the .csv file?
-	Is it ok to use pandas for insert and delete and update stuff?
-	Tables should be case sensitive but test this 
- Do we need to join where the column name on the left and column name on the right could be different and join on multiple attributes?
- Is grouping by at most 1 attribute enough?

# to-do
  - connect the scripts together
